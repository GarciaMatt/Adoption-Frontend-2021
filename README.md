# Pet Adoption Website Mock Frontend

This repository contains a static multi-page website that serves as a mock frontend for a pet adoption website. It was created during my first web development class in my freshman year of college. After getting some advice from a volunteering graphic design student, I was able to find a guide to create this site as my first full web development project.
